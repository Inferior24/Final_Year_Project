# API Documentation and Query Assistant Optimizer using RAG
## Project Overview
This project presents an innovative API Documentation and Query Assistant Optimizer that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to provide intelligent, context-aware recommendations for API documentation queries. The system addresses the common challenge developers face when navigating complex API documentation by offering both accurate information retrieval and optimized resource recommendations.

# Problem Statement
Developers often struggle with:

1. Information Overload: Extensive API documentation makes finding relevant information time-consuming.
2. Context Loss: Traditional search methods fail to understand query context and intent.
3. Suboptimal Resource Selection: Difficulty in choosing the best API endpoints or resources from multiple options.
4. Fragmented Knowledge: Information scattered across different documentation sources.

# Solution Architecture
## Our system integrates three core components:

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
Document Processing: Intelligent chunking and preprocessing of API documentation.

Vector Storage: FAISS-based vector database for efficient similarity search.

Context Retrieval: Semantic search to find most relevant documentation segments.

Answer Generation: LLM-powered response generation using retrieved context.

### 2. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Integration
TOPSIS Method: Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution.

SAW Method: Simple Additive Weighting for comprehensive evaluation.

Criteria-Based Ranking: Evaluation based on multiple factors (performance, reliability, documentation quality, popularity).

### 3. RESTful API Framework
FastAPI Backend: High-performance API endpoints.

Authentication Layer: Secure access control.

Comprehensive Testing: Automated testing suite with pytest and Postman.

# Key Innovations & Novelty
## Hybrid Intelligence Approach
First-of-its-kind integration of RAG with MCDM methods for API documentation.

Dual-mode operation: Direct query answering + intelligent recommendation system.

Context-aware ranking that considers both semantic relevance and quantitative metrics.

## Multi-Dimensional Optimization
Beyond simple retrieval: Incorporates performance metrics, user preferences, and documentation quality.

Comparative analysis: RAG-only vs RAG+MCDM result evaluation.

Adaptive ranking: Dynamic weight adjustment based on query context.

## Intelligent Query Processing
Semantic understanding: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand developer intent.

Contextual recommendations: Suggests optimal API endpoints based on use case requirements.

Progressive refinement: System learns from query patterns to improve recommendations.
